Description:
	DROL (Double Register Optimization Language) is a virtual register language, and acts by simulating two virtual registers (which are in reality just integers of the `int' C type). The DROL compiler calls GCC by default to compile the C source. If GCC is not present or aliased on your machine, use the `-c' flag  and then compile with the C compiler of your choice.

CLI Flags:
	-c : Compile into C source file named `a.c', but not into executable.

Explanation:
	DROL is a double virtual register language, and as such, contains two "registers" (integers of the `int' C type) that can be manipulated using different single-character commands. Each register has its own distinct set of commands.

Notable Commands:
	Some notable commands are:
i,k - Increment
d,e - Decrement
o,p - Display number
a,b - Display character
n,q - Set register to user input
z,y - Set register to zero
* - Swap the contents of the registers
j - Test if registers are equal, if unequal, exit program
! - Display newline
0 - Do nothing
x - Exit program successfully
