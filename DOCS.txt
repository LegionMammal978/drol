Description:
	DROL (Double Register Optimization Language) is a virtual register language, and acts by 
simulating two virtual registers (which are in reality just integers of the `int' C type). The DROL 
compiler calls GCC by default to compile the C source. If GCC is not present or aliased on your 
machine, use the `-c' flag  and then compile with the C compiler of your choice. It is standard 
practice to name DROL source files with the `.drol' extension.

CLI Flags:
	-c : Compile into C source file named `a.c', but not into executable.

Explanation:
	DROL is a double virtual register language, and as such, contains two "registers" (integers 
of the `int' C type) that can be manipulated using different single-character commands. Each 
register has its own distinct set of commands.

Notable Commands:
	Some notable commands are:
i,k - Increment
d,e - Decrement
o,p - Display number
a,b - Display character
n,q - Set register to user input
z,y - Set register to zero
* - Swap the contents of the registers
j - If the registers are equal execute the next two commands, if not execute the two commands after 
	that one
w - While the registers are inequal execute the next three commands (in a loop)
! - Display newline
0 - Do nothing
x - Exit program successfully

Common pitfalls:
	1. Both the four/three (respectively) commands immediately after `j' and `w' cannot be `j' or `w'.
	2. The four commands after `j' are reserved. Similarly, the three commands after `w' are reserved.
	3. The `!' command exists for a reason: use it! (Why set your registers to 10 to display a newline when you don't have to?)
